# This script uses the Blue Robotics Ping360 scanning sonar to collect and process sonar data.

"""
Author: Md Junayed Hasan
Teams: Bryan Bourdin, Hamid Reza Farhadi
Context: Using bluerobotics Ping360 sonar, we have collected the underwater sonar data.
This module heavily relies on the documentation and APIs provided by Blue Robotics for the Ping360 sonar.
